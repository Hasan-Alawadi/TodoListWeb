To-Do List Application
Overview

This is a simple to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to log in, add tasks to a list, and log out.

Features

Login: Users can log in with a username and password.
Task Creation: Users can add new tasks to the list.
Task Display: Added tasks are displayed in a list.
Logout: Users can log out of the application.

How it Works

Login: When a user enters a username and password and clicks the "Login" button, the JavaScript code checks if the credentials are valid. If they are, the login form is hidden, and the to-do list is displayed.
Task Creation: When a user enters a task and clicks the "Add Task" button, the JavaScript code adds the task to the list.
Logout: When a user clicks the "Logout" button, the to-do list is hidden, and the login form is displayed.
